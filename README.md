# CodeWars Challenges

Welcome to my **CodeWars Challenges** repository! ðŸš€

This repo contains solutions to various coding challenges and katas that I've solved on [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/). The purpose of this repository is to document my problem-solving journey, sharpen my programming skills, and showcase my progress as I work through increasingly difficult challenges.

## Structure

Each challenge solution is structured in its own folder, with accompanying test cases where applicable. Below is a typical structure for a challenge:

â”œâ”€â”€ ChallengeName â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ ChallengeName.cs // Solution to the challenge â”‚ â””â”€â”€ ChallengeNameTests.cs // Unit tests for the solution


## Languages and Tools

Most of the challenges are solved using **C#**, leveraging:

- **.NET Core**
- **LINQ** for clean and efficient data manipulation
- **XUnit** for unit testing the solutions

## Why This Repo?

The goal of this repository is to:

- **Document my learning process** and improvement over time
- **Share solutions** to common programming challenges
- **Collaborate** with others to review and improve solutions
- **Encourage others** to engage in coding challenges to enhance problem-solving skills

## Running the Solutions Locally

If you'd like to run these solutions locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/codewars-challenges.git
    ```

2. Open the solution in an IDE like **Visual Studio** or **VS Code**.

3. Navigate to the specific challenge folder and run the unit tests:
    ```bash
    dotnet test
    ```

4. Feel free to explore the challenges and experiment with your own solutions!

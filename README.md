# CodeWars Challenges

![CodeWars Badge](https://www.codewars.com/users/sekhubede/badges/small)

Welcome to my **CodeWars Challenges** repository! ðŸš€  

This repo contains solutions to various coding challenges and katas that I've solved on [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/). The purpose of this repository is to document my problem-solving journey, sharpen my programming skills, and showcase my progress as I work through increasingly difficult challenges.

## Challenge Organization  

I use the **CodeHub** Chrome extension to automatically push my CodeWars solutions to this repository. This allows me to focus purely on problem-solving without worrying about manual updates.  

Each challenge is categorized by **difficulty level** (e.g., `8-kyu`, `7-kyu`, etc.), and every challenge folder includes:  
- `README.md` â†’ Challenge description and solution.

If you're interested in automating your CodeWars submissions, check out **[CodeHub on GitHub](https://github.com/febinbellamy/CodeHub)**.  

## Why This Repo?  

The goal of this repository is to:  
- **Document my learning process** and improvement over time.  
- **Automate submissions** so I can focus on problem-solving.  
- **Share solutions** to common programming challenges.  
- **Encourage others** to engage in coding challenges to enhance problem-solving skills.  

## Running the Solutions Locally  

If you'd like to run these solutions locally, follow these steps:  

1. Clone the repository:  
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/codewars-challenges.git
    ```  
2. Open the solution in **Visual Studio**, **VS Code**, or your preferred C# editor.  
3. Navigate to the specific challenge folder and modify/test the solution as needed.

# CodeWars Challenges

Welcome to my **CodeWars Challenges** repository! ðŸš€

This repo contains solutions to various coding challenges and katas that I've solved on [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/). The purpose of this repository is to document my problem-solving journey, sharpen my programming skills, and showcase my progress as I work through increasingly difficult challenges.

## Structure

Each challenge solution is structured in its own folder, with accompanying test cases where applicable. Below is a typical structure for a challenge:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ challenges/                  # Folder containing all the challenges
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ bus-people-challenge/    # Folder for a specific challenge
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ solution.cs          # Solution to the challenge
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md            # Description of the challenge and solution
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ another-challenge/       # Another challenge folder
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ solution.cs
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ README.md
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/                       # Folder for tests
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ BusPeopleTests.cs        # Test class for bus-people-challenge
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ AnotherChallengeTests.cs # Test class for another challenge
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                    # Main readme file for the project overview
â””â”€â”€ .gitignore                   # Git ignore file
```

## Languages and Tools

Most of the challenges are solved using **C#**, leveraging:

- **.NET Core**
- **LINQ** for clean and efficient data manipulation
- **XUnit** for unit testing the solutions
- **FluentAssertions** for expressive and readable assertions in the tests

## Why This Repo?

The goal of this repository is to:

- **Document my learning process** and improvement over time
- **Share solutions** to common programming challenges
- **Collaborate** with others to review and improve solutions
- **Encourage others** to engage in coding challenges to enhance problem-solving skills

## Running the Solutions Locally

If you'd like to run these solutions locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/codewars-challenges.git
    ```

2. Open the solution in an IDE like **Visual Studio** or **VS Code**.

3. Navigate to the specific challenge folder and run the unit tests:
    ```bash
    dotnet test
    ```

4. Feel free to explore the challenges and experiment with your own solutions!
